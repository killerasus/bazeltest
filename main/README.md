# main

This package will be compiled into an executable. In the `BUILD` file, you find the description of the executable project:

```bazel
cc_binary(
    name = "hello-world",
    srcs = ["src/main.cpp"],
    deps = ["//library:bazellibtest"],
)
```

It states that a C++ program will be built, referenced by the name `hello-world`. It depends on an external package (`library`) linking with the lib `bazellibtest` generated by that package.
